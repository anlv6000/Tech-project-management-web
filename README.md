# Tech Project Management (Demo)

This repository contains a minimal, separate frontend (React) and backend (Node.js) implementation to demonstrate the use cases from the attached diagram. The backend currently runs with a file-backed fake database (`db.json`) for easy local development; later you can switch to MongoDB.

Contents
- `my-backend` — Node.js/Express API with a file-backed fake DB and JWT auth.
- `my-frontend` — React app (Create React App) that talks to the backend.

This README contains quick run steps; see the `my-backend/README.md` and `my-frontend/README.md` for component-specific instructions.
